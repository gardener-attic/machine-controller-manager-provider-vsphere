# machine-controller-manager-provider-vsphere

This project contains the external/out-of-tree plugin (driver) implementation of machine-controller-manager for
VMware `vSphere`.

## Prerequisites

- vSphere installation, user with permissions to create/delete VMs in the specified data center.
  Details see below [Recommended permissions for role of vSphere user](#recommended-permissions-for-role-of-vsphere-user)
- A vSphere network with an DHCP server. For Gardener, the network is created by the vsphere infrastructure
  controller, which needs VMware NSX-T to setup the software-defined network, SNAT and DHCP.
- Suitable VM templates must already be deployed on vSphere. The provider uses the `guestId` to identify the
  correct way to initiate a cloud-init.
  Supported OS are
  - CoreOS images using igniton for cloud-init (see https://stable.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr for images)
    In this case make sure, that the `guestId` is overwritten with `coreos64Guest` in the ProviderSpec.
  - Other Linux cloud images with a cloud-init VApp (e.g. Ubuntu at https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases)
    can be used if they meet the requirements like Docker, SystemD, ... (see
    [Gardener contract for OperationSystemConfig](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/extensions/operatingsystemconfig.md)
    for more details) but this is still in early stage.

## Supported vSphere versions

This provider has been tested with vSphere 6.7 (Update 3) and vSphere 7.0 (Update 3d)

## Recommended permissions for role of vSphere user

The vSphere user used for this provider should have been assigned to a role including these permissions

with `Global Permissions`)
